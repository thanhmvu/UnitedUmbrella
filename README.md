# United Umbrella
United Umbrella is a web appication that provides user-friendly, searchable interface for more than 200,000 data points of several datasets from Pennsylvania Department of Education. The app was created under the supervision of Dr. Joann J. Ordille for the use of United Way of the Greater Lehigh Valley. This project, along with four others, was later intergrated into a united, large-scale database system with a web-based [interface](http://www.laf-tech.org/). More information about this system can be found [here](http://sites.lafayette.edu/ordillej/projects/united-way-project-overview/).
